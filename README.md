# Go Learning Project

Go learning project! ðŸŽ‰

This repository is a collection of Go programming exercises, projects, and experiments that I am working on to learn Go Lang. It contains various small programs, snippets, and explorations into Go concepts like concurrency, networking, data structures, and more.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to get hands-on experience with Go and improve my understanding of the language.

## Progress

- Basics of Go: Variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- Working with arrays, slices, and maps.
- Learning about Go routines and concurrency.
- Building simple REST APIs using Go.

## Learning Resources

Here are some of the resources I found helpful in my Go journey:

- [Go Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/)
